/**
 * The Woolie simulates a Woolie crossing a TrollsBridge.
 * Each woolie has a name, a duration of time it takes the woolie to cross a bridge, a destination city (Sicstine or
 * Merctran), and a reference to troll who coordinates how woolies traverse the bridge.
 * Before crossing, a woolie has to ask the troll guarding the bridge to grant him/her access. Only after the troll grants
 * permission can the woolie begin crossing the bridge. After comopletely traversing the bridge, the woolie must notify
 * the troll and every other woolie that it is no longer on the bridge.
