# CONFIG FILE FOR PATHBUILDER PROJECT PART 1 TESTING
# Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with # are ignored.
# All other lines are processed.

# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# NOTE: THIS CONFIG FILE SHOULD NOT BE MODIFIED.
# THE PARAMETERS AND CORRESPONDING RESULT ARE A SPECIFIC
# TEST PROVIDED FOR YOU TO CHECK YOUR PART 1 SOLUTION.
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# This config file format is intended for use with
# Part1Test.java.

# NOTE: the GUI is not used for part 1 testing.

# NOTE: PLAYERS is not used in PART 1 config file.  The player
# to be tested is instead provided via a command line argument
# when running the program.  Also, TIMELIMIT is not specified
# in this config file, but internally a 10 second limit
# is used to limit the allowed computation by the player
# for any method call (this should not be an issue).

# PART must be present with value 1 to indicate that this
# config file is appropriate for PART 1 testing
PART 1

# DIM is used to indicate the size of the smaller dimension
# of the grid of nodes for each player.
# It must have an integer value in the range 3-20.
# The larger dimension always has value DIM+1.
# Both players nodes can be placed on an overall grid of
# size (2*DIM+1) by (2*DIM+1).
# DIM has a default value of 6 if it is not specified in
# the configuration file.
DIM 6

# a PREMOVE is used to get the game started with
# a specific move before calling the
# HUMAN / player modules for moves.
# a PREMOVE must have three comma-separated values,
# with no spaces, indicating row, column and player id
# for the move.
# Multiple PREMOVE lines are allowed, and are processed in order.
# An invalid PREMOVE will cause a game error.
# PREMOVE lines are optional.
